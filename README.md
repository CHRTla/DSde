# Домашнее задание #3

*The following text is from the previous homework*
## General functions

*git init* makes your active folder into a git repository

*git add* with a file name prepares that said file to be committed

*git commit -m "yourCommentHere"* creates a commit and allows to get back to the committed state

## Branch creation
To create a new branch simply type a command *git branch*, add a name of the branch after it and hit *Enter/Return*

## Branch merging
To add data from the other branch into the active one you need to type *branch merge*, add the name of the desired branch after it and hit *Enter/Return*

There are several types of merging:

* Fast-Forward - when the merged branch has all the data from the master branch;
* Ort strategy - when the master branch has some extra data compared to the merged branch but there are no conflicts.

## Conflicts solving
Sometimes during merges you can encounter conflicts. It happens when the master branch and the merging branch have different data in the same place. In that case you have to manually choose what data to save and what to discard.
