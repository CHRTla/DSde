## How to work with remote repository

### How to make a pull request

* Creating a fork of the remote repository in GitHub
* Make a clone of our version of repository in terminal with **git clone paste_the_link**
* Create new branch with **git branch name_of_branch** and make our changes there
* Add our changes to git with **git add** 
* Do commit of our changes with **git commit -m " "**
* Send our version to GitHub with **git push -u origin master**
* On the GitHub website click **pull request** button

# Instructions for working with Markdown

## Selecting text
In order to make our text italic, we need to frame them with stars (*) or with underline (_). For example *Like this* or _Like this_.

In order to make our text bold, we need to frame them with double stars (**) or with double underline (__). For example **Like this** or __Like this__.
We can combine both methods of highliting the text, for using together italic and bold, for examply _**Like this**_.

= or - is highlighting headers
~~ lining text ~~Like this~~

## Lists
In order to add unnumbered lists, we need to highlight them with star (*) or with +.
For example:
* Element 1
* Element 2
* Element 3
+ Element 4

In order to add numbered lists, we need to highlight them with numbers. For example:
1. Element 1
2. Element 2
3. Element 3

## Working with images
In order to add images to the text we need to write following: (   ![]()  ). For example:
![Hi, I am thunder](thunder.jpg)
